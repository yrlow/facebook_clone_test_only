## Simple Facebook clone


This is a mock exercise for rails assessment.



## To Start
1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone the repo down to your local machine
3. Add ruby version on gemfile.
4. Work on your solution.
5. Push and commit as frequent as possible (at least every 2 hours).




## Guard
This project uses `guard` and `guard-rspec`. In your terminal, run:

    $ bundle exec guard

and it will show something like the following:

    21:23:55 - INFO - Guard::RSpec is running
    21:23:55 - INFO - Guard is now watching at 'xxx'
    [1] guard(main)>

Whenever you save a file, `guard` will automatically run your tests.

## Filtering tests

There are a lot of tests, and you may get overwhelmed. If you want to focus on just one test that you're trying to implement, see https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-4/docs/filtering/inclusion-filters#focus-on-an-example
